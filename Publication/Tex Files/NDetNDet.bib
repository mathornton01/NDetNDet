abstract={Devices manufactured in 20 nm and smaller geometry technologies will potentially be very large by today's standards, they will also have new characteristics implied by things like process variability and adoption of FinFET transistors. The industry has cumulatively adopted more and more sophisticated fault models that use timing as well as layout information. There is a growing body of experimental data showing it is still insufficient. The next area of focus will be the quality of test. Cell-aware test is one of the most promising approaches developed over the last five years aimed at improving the quality of test while maintaining the efficiency of gate-level approach. This approach combines two levels of abstraction to provide trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The first step creates the cell-aware test library models. It starts with standard cell libraries and performs layout extraction. Realistic defects (bridges and opens) are injected into the SPICE netlist, and analog fault simulation is performed to determine the conditions under which the defects are detected. Those conditions are aggregated to create a compact and efficient representation of the libraries for ATPG done at the gate-level. Generation of library views for cell-aware test is performed only once for a given standard cell library. The final cell-aware ATPG generates the high quality test patterns based on the cell-aware library views. This guarantees that the investment in gate-level ATPG infrastructure could be efficiently utilized. The technology has been used on a number of high-volume industrial designs. The experimental data show a significant increase of defect coverage and the corresponding improvement of defect rate.},

We present highvolume production test results from a 32-nm notebook processor to which CA test patterns were applied, including the defect rate reduction in PPM that was achieved after testing 800,000 parts.

abstract={Industry is facing increasingly tougher quality requirements for more complex ICs. To meet these quality requirements we need to improve the defect coverage. This paper presents a new methodology to significantly increase the defect coverage of the test patterns generated by ATPG tools. The fault model used during the ATPG is enhanced to directly target layout-based intra-cell faults. In contrast to previous techniques, such as gate-exhaustive, N-detect, or embedded-multi-detect, which either are too complex for real-world designs or merely improve the probability of detecting intra-cell defects, the new approach targets the actual root causes of intra-cell defects. The newly proposed cell-aware-methodology has been evaluated for 90 nm and 65 nm technologies on 1671 library cells and on 10 real industrial designs with up to 50 million faults. The experimental results show an average increase of 1.2% in defect coverage and a reduction of 420 ppm in escape rate for a 50 mm2 design.},

abstract={Defective part levels of zero are almost impossible to achieve in an era of complex defects, process variations, and limited testing resources. It is important to ensure that any defects missed during test will impact the end user as little as possible. However, optimizing test sets for superior detection of critical defects requires an understanding of relative fault criticality, and this determination may be very expensive. In this paper, we will present a method which efficiently estimates this criticality under realistic usage conditions using a translation between combinational and sequential fault analysis. We will show that the resulting criticalities are sufficiently accurate to select an optimized test set which is as effective as one created with perfect criticality information.},

abstract={Error tolerance is evolving into a new computing paradigm with further technology scaling, cost constraint, system scalability and emerging applications. Distinguished from defect tolerance and fault tolerance, error tolerance is based on application characteristics and relaxes the constraint of 100 percent functional correctness. From the viewpoint of error tolerance, this paper proposes a framework across multiple layers for fault criticality evaluation. Furthermore, taking an H.264/AVC decoder as an example, fault injection experiments demonstrate that for different functional modules, the faults in them bear different fault criticalities because of their unbalanced effects on applications, the faults in the same module also have diverse fault criticalities. The information that which faults are most critical can aid in test for yield and design for cost-effective fault tolerance. Error control techniques can be used to suppress error propagation and make more faults acceptable.},

abstract={In this paper, we illustrate that the traditional N-detect ATPG is unoptimized in terms of the size of the generated pattern set. The optimization problem is formulated as a minimum covering problem. Integer linear programming (ILP) is applied to obtain an N-detection ATPG pattern set with the minimum number of patterns. A heuristic method is also proposed to obtain sub-optimal solutions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed method, the number of N-detection patterns can be reduced by about 18% for N=3 and about 13% for N=5 without compromising N-detection objective},

The data presented shows that N-detect test sets are particularly effective for both timing and hard failures. In these test sets each single-stuck fault is detected by at least N different test patterns.

Unfortunately, the types of defects are also becoming more complex, which in turn makes simple approaches for testing inadequate. Using n-detect testing can improve detect coverage; however, this approach can greatly increase the test set size. In this proof-of-concept paper we investigate the use of logic implication checkers, inserted in hardware, as an aid in compacting n-detect test sets. We show that checker hardware with minimal area overhead can reduce test set size by up to 25%. In addition, this implication checker can serve a dual purpose for online error detection.},
